    <h2>Understanding Statistical Independence</h2>

    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>Statistical independence is a key principle in probability theory. It describes a scenario where two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event happening.</p>
            <p>For two events \(A\) and \(B\), they are independent if the probability of both events occurring simultaneously is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Formal Definition</h3>
            <p>Two events \(A\) and \(B\) are considered independent if and only if:</p>
            <p><strong>\( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \)</strong></p>
            <p>Here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( P(A \cap B) \): Probability that both events \(A\) and \(B\) occur simultaneously.</li>
                <li>\( P(A) \): Probability that event \(A\) occurs.</li>
                <li>\( P(B) \): Probability that event \(B\) occurs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Example: Rolling Two Dice</h3>
            <p>Consider rolling two fair dice. Let:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>\(A\)</strong>: The event that the first die shows a 4.</li>
                <li><strong>\(B\)</strong>: The event that the second die shows a 6.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the outcome of one die does not affect the outcome of the other, events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent. Their probabilities are calculated as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>\( P(A) = \frac{1}{6} \)</strong> (probability that the first die shows 4).</li>
                <li><strong>\( P(B) = \frac{1}{6} \)</strong> (probability that the second die shows 6).</li>
                <li><strong>\( P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36} \)</strong> (probability that both dice show the specified values).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \), events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Analogy with Conditional Probability</h3>
            <p>If two events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, then knowing that \(B\) has occurred does not change the probability of \(A\) occurring:</p>
            <p><strong>\( P(A | B) = P(A) \)</strong> and similarly <strong>\( P(B | A) = P(B) \)</strong>.</p>
            <p>This means that for independent events, the occurrence of one event provides no additional information about the likelihood of the other event occurring.</p>
